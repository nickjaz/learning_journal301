### Learning Journal 3- CODE 301

Today we had our weekly recap. Most of this week was about jQuery, templates and responsive design. Jquery is a library I find very useful after having to traverse and manipulate the DOM over and over again in my 201 project. Now I have the tools to be able to make that project in much less time. Templates are the first real look into dynamic web development by using handlebars to compile data from JS and plug it into the web page.

My favorite of all the topics is responsive design. As a developer who is interested in front end work, putting all the pieces together to build a responsive site is a lot of fun (most of the time).
