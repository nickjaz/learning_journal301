## Learning Journal 7 - CODE 301

Today we reviewed single page apps and started learning client side routing. At the start of lecture I struggled to wrap my mind around the concepts. Having not totally understood server side routing the new subject was just adding to the fog. Page js is the library we use to route the user to a "new" page changing the information that appears. I made sure to take careful notes through out the class. Only once Brian performed demonstration of client side routing did it click for me. Once I understood that topic it shed some light server side routing as well.

Moving forward I continue to seek these a-ha moments knowing thats its okay to not totally understand a topic. I'm making progress on making my portfolio page a single page app.
