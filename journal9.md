## Learning Journal 9 - CODE 301

Today in class we had our course recap and introduction to SCSS styling. In addition we had a good lunch and learn where I was given a fresh outlook on interviewing in the tech industry. The SCSS workshop opened a whole new door into styling. Being able to save styles to variables and nesting the elements will greatly impact the time and effort put into CSS (more DRY code).

Looking ahead I'm excited to start project week. We have been discussing and outlining our mvp all afternoon. It should be fun to make selfie spots.
