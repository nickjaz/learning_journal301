### Learning Journal 6 - CODE 301

Today we started with the week two friday review. In which we reiterated over the most important topics of week. On a higher level we just got our first look into what a full stack app looks like from the ground up. The challenge for me was the introduction of the server, databases and database management systems. Now that we've moved beyond the front-end I struggle with the intangibility of data storage and how it connect to the front.

Moving forward I now know the subject that tests me the most. Over the next week I'm making it my priority to really grasp the concepts and be able to implement them.
