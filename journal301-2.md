### Learning Journal 2- 301

Today we covered jQuery events. UX and UI are two subjects I've been interested in since we started class. jQuery events tap into that interest. After building the animations and render function with vanilla javascript for my 201 final project what I learned today was very applicable to what I was I doing then. I will be for sure be using many many jQuery events moving forward.

Looking ahead I need to become a more diligent time manager now that the structure of the class has switched to morning lab. I'll have be my own boss and set aside the time need to get my work done.
