### Learning Journal 1- 301

Today in class we touched on many of the broad topics we will eventually dive deeper into later in the course. We also branched off and talked about the new git flow habits that will be part of our assignments. Many of the new subjects are getting closer to what we would see in a tech company. We covered things like user stories, mvc, responsive web design and agile programming.

I'm really looking forward to peer programming and working with more students in the class and learning more about responsive development.
