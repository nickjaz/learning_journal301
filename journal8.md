## Learning Journal 8 - CODE 301

Today we discussed heroku deployment and our code 301 projects. Brian explained the general workflow we will follow while working on our final projects next week. After that we went through step by step on how to deploy on heroku.

Moving ahead I'm looking forward to starting project week. I still need to get my portfolio page working but that will be my focus going into the weekend.
