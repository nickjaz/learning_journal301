### Learning Journal 5 - CODE 301

Today we built out a database from scratch. This is really the first time we have taken a good look at what back end development looks like. For the first time in the class I've started to struggled with connecting all the concepts from the demonstration in class. It is a lot of information to take in and I'll be really surprised if I get full points on the lab.

Moving forward I hope with repetition and some more discussion that servers and databases will make more sense to me. I will go over the lab code and in class demonstration code again so I can get a better understanding of the process.
